Tracking using Blockchain Technology 
Cattle Tracing

# Inspiration:
 
Commercial farmers have seen a spike in loosing their cattle in the recent years, staticsics say that more than 40% of the cattle is being left free for wandering. The cattle is left for a free roam which makes them loos away from teh main cattle. Using cutting edge technologies, we might be able to solve this upto some extent. This can be cleraly said that this is die to to improper care towards teh cattle. 

# Proposd Solution:

The prototyped solution would have an near-changing impact on the saving of cattle from getting lost. This helps us to keep the animals in track so that we can monitor day-n-night. 

# How we built it?

The coming solution deals with the trcing of animals into a systematic leadger. Farmers can move their cattle stocks from one area to another area without worrying about the loss of any. They can get a clear visibility of the locations of all animals and all the animals movements between farms.

The whole concepts works as follows:
1) Farmers areowning their own bussiness and a set of his/her animals
2) The animals are usually transfered from the fields to farmers shed 
3) Considering the places as 2 individual businesses-
 Animals move from the filed to business 1 and business 2

As the number of registrations increases in the animal directory, directly increases in the number of participants and regulatos. 

All of this considers into working as a transaction. A systematic ledger gets working by noting all the moves of the animal between business. 

And once a transaction is confirmed, the receipt ensure the proper tracking of the cattle.

# Challenges we ran into: - 

1) Getting to know how to approach this, since we took up a different probelm to solve
2) Getting confused to work on different technological stacks.

# Accomplishments we are proud of: -

Even during these hard times of the global lockdown, we were able to fulfil our requirement to complete the event we desire-fully started. We were happy to get to know that we completed what we always wanted to do. Now we belive that, we can achieve anything irrespective of the tasks difficulty level. 

# Future Steps: -
1) We are plannig to make it even more simple for everyone for a better usage.
2) Easily accessible for the real farmers.
